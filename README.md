# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

Repository explores patient data on Myopia. Using PCA, tSNE and k-means clustering, we attempt to cluster patients into seperate groups using unsupervised machine learning. These seperated groups can then be used in a supervised machine learning model seperately, to predict the presence of myopia.
